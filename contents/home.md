### About Me

Hi, I’m Kong, originally from the vibrant city of Hong Kong, and I am currently pursuing a PhD in Electrical Engineering at Northwestern University, USA. My research centers on **spintronic devices** and **in-memory computing** with a focus on the next generation of memory and chip technologies.

My research journey began during my third year at HKUST, where I first measured magnetic material properties before transitioning to the fabrication of advanced memory and spintronic devices. Throughout my studies, I developed an automatic measurement program in Python during my undergraduate years, and during my master's, I gained hands-on experience in memory unit fabrication. Now, as a PhD student, I am eager to push the boundaries of innovation in spintronics and contribute to the future of electrical engineering.
