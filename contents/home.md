### About me

Hi, I am Kong, hailing from the vibrant city of Hong Kong. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Electrical Engineering at Northwestern University, USA.

My research focuses on <strong>spintronic devices</strong> and <strong>in-memory computing</strong>. I began my research journey during my third year at HKUST, where I initially measured magnetic material properties before transitioning to the fabrication of advanced memory and next-generation chips. During my undergraduate studies, I developed an automatic measurement program in Python, and during my master’s, I was trained in fabricating memory units.

I am passionate about advancing technology and look forward to contributing to the field of electrical engineering through innovative research and development.
