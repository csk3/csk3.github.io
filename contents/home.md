### About me

Hi I am Kong, I am from Hong Kong. 
My research focuses on <strong>spintronic devices</strong> and <strong>in-memory computing</strong>. I began my research journey during my third year at HKUST, where I initially measured magnetic material properties before transitioning to the fabrication of advanced memory and next-generation chips. During my undergraduate studies, I developed an automatic measurement program in Python, and during my masterâ€™s, I was trained in fabricating memory units.
